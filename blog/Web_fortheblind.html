    How do the Blind Surf the Web?
  </h1>
  <p>
     Of course we know the blind can read using braille, but the dots and bumps can't really do justice to the flow and structure of a web page. And while there are braille readers for the web, most often text-to-speech programs are used instead. <br> The problem with these programs is that they read <i>everything</i> on the page. For those of us blessed with sight, we can think of how we would read a page and realize how little of it we actually need to read to find a given piece of information.  Designers have trained our eyes to be drawn to the most important stuff. But for those without that advantage, they must slog through lots of unnecessary info to get to the couple of sentences they might want. <br>
     There are many ways to make the web easier for those using screen readers, many of which are outlined and standardized by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">w3 organization.</a>  One of the most common is "alt" text for images, which is included in the image tag and describes the image for those who can't see it, even if it just doesn't load right!<br> <img src="http://web.stanford.edu/~siegelr/galapagos/galapagos2010/IMG_9833%20sea%20lion%20resize.jpg" alt='Sea Lion' height = 100px width = 100px>
     <br>
     When considering the flow of the page for the vision impaired, think about what it would be like if you had to read every page with just the raw html. Does your header contain things that make sense for a header? Are there side elements and other distractions interrupting the main body of the html? The difference between semantic elements can be very important for the blind, for example em and i tags. These two render the same visually, but can be very different for a speech device.

     The American Foundation for the Blind has been advocating for better access and regulations for many years.  More recently they have been fighting for exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) because it creates problems when trying to legally convert copyrighted media into something more accessible to the disabled.
