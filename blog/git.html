      So we learned about Version control this week, and it seems pretty neat. It lets to very carefully add new things to your projects so that they don't explode, and when the end up exploding anyway, you can hit the undo button and it goes back to how it was.  Kinda wish I had something like this for my whole life. Anyway, this seems like it becomes exponentially more important the more people are working on your project.

        Git is a helpful version control tool that stores the changes made by each commit, as well as a description of those changes, who made them, and when.  It will allow you to see exactly when things went wrong and revert these changes.

        Github, on the other hand is a cloud based version of git that helps you coordinate over the internet.  Not only is it a backup for your home computer, it lets others see, comment on, and modify your stuff.
