How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was sort of tough to get our heads together, but over all kinda fun.  We justed messed around until we liked what we had, then pieced together what we needed in html.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I can see how it is very useful yes, but at this point I will admit I do not know how to do most of the stuff we wanted to do on the wireframe, so it was a bit frustrating.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

Simple, broad page layout, making sure we had all the essentials covered, like title, back and forward buttons for blog posts, home page link, date, search bar, etc.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

Buttons can be done with the <button> tag but you also need the type and what it does on click.  I also learned the <center> tag to center text.
