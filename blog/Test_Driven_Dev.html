  Test Driven Development.
  </h1>
  <p>
  Test driven development is a method of writing code that first makes test cases that check to see if a program works as intended with a given input.
  This is done for several reasons.  First it helps to clearly identify the goal of the problem, because you are forced to break it into smaller tests.
  Second, it helps you write better code by making sure that you always pass all tests at once.  Finally, good tests help yourself and others to understand what is needed without as many wordy comments. At dev bootcamp we have used both Ruby and Javascript test code as you may remember.

  The basic flow of the process is fairly simple:

  As you add tests, your code will still be running the older tests, ensuring that your code is written for most cases for the final product.
  With more complex programs, you will never be able to write enough tests to cover every possible situation. But if the tests are written well, they should cover a lot.  Of course, test driven development does not replace the need for traditional testing.
