1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.    https://jpults.github.io
2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person. Creating a repository is like creating a new main file and you can do it from the github account page. To actually modify the files in that repository, you need to clone or copy it to your computer using the terminal.
3. Describe what open source means.  Both the source code and the actual program are available to anyone free of charge over the internet.  Sometimes this means that people help improve the product, other times it just means that they can take it and use or change it how they will.
4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? It reminds me of the new Tron movie.  But yeah its pretty cool, and it gets more exciting when I think about what stuff I might be able to do when I improve at coding. I'm not sure if I have anything worth protecting code wise yet. (Okay I am sure I don't).
5. Assess the importance of using licenses. They seem to allow you to dictate what happens to your code when you give it away, such as whether others can sell it, modify and then sell it, or use it at all. 
6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? This challenge definitely hammered in how to make branches, commit changes, then push and merge those changes to github.  I had trouble at first merging branches to the master, until I realized I was trying to do so onto the main Dev-bootcamp repo in the last challenge.  I am also happy at how easy it was to "publish" a webpage.
