1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Padding is space between the text and the edge of the element. Borders are a line around the element, and margin is space between other elements.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It is very tricky. You have to make sure you understand how your tags are layered and how the different css properties change them very well. For example, a block element will keep its shape in the layout, while an inline will wrap around other things.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest was the text sizes and colors.  The most difficult was the side bar and navigation bar because they involved multiple ids and tags.

4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned to use ID's when there is just one tag I want to change. I learned that it is important to be aware of how your tags are nested in the html.
